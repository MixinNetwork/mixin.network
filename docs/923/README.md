# Mixin 923 Hacker Incident Disclosure and Progress
(Updated March 12, 2024)

## Incident Description
Mixin Network was attacked by hackers on September 23, 2023. The main assets targeted in this attack were ETH, BTC, and USDT-ERC20, with varying losses in other coins. The addresses of the three main hackers are:

- [https://etherscan.io/address/0x52e86988bd07447c596e9b0c7765f8500113104c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x52e86988bd07447c596e9b0c7765f8500113104c)
- [https://explorer.btc.com/btc/address/bc1qq7uefmz6nng5c4dzs9mwrxxyh9sxg5cjg85hes](https://explorer.btc.com/btc/address/bc1qq7uefmz6nng5c4dzs9mwrxxyh9sxg5cjg85hes)
- [https://etherscan.io/address/0x3B5fb9d9da3546e9CE6E5AA3CCEca14C8D20041e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3B5fb9d9da3546e9CE6E5AA3CCEca14C8D20041e)

The primary cause of the incident was the hacker's penetration into the Google Cloud Services relied upon by Mixin for withdrawals, exploiting a software vulnerability to construct a large number of unauthorized withdrawal requests.

## Incident Response

### Investigation and Tracking
    
Upon discovering a large number of abnormal withdrawals, we immediately halted all deposit and withdrawal services on the network. Other measures included:
    
- Contacting blockchain security companies like Slowmist for on-chain tracking.
- Hiring the Google Mandiant team to assist in investigating the hack into Google Cloud Services.
- Announcing a $20 million reward for the return of the stolen assets.
    
As of now, the stolen assets remain in the addresses without being moved, and the cause of the breach is still under investigation.
    
### Debt Assessment
    
After assessing the stolen assets, the team's existing funds, and communicating with the community, major holders, and investors, and considering Mixin's huge potential for future development, the following is announced:
    
- The Mixin team will use existing funds to cover some or all losses for different affected coin types.
- Losses in BTC, ETH, and USDT-ERC20 that cannot be covered will be converted into a fixed debt based on their dollar value at the time of theft, totaling $153 million in debt. The Mixin team commits to repaying 100% of this debt. The table below details this:
    
| Coin | Loss | Assessment Price | Total Assessment | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BTC | 10% | 26569 USD | 30,000,000 USD | Old system 1 BTC â‡’ New system 0.9 BTC + 2656.9 USD debt |
| ETH | 70% | 1592.74 USD | 100,000,000 USD | Old system 1 ETH â‡’ New system 0.3 ETH + 1114.918 USD debt |
| USDT-ERC20 | 90% | 1 USD | 23,000,000 USD | Old system 1 USDT-ERC20 â‡’ New system 0.1 USDT-ERC20 + 0.9 USD debt |

- If the hacker returns the assets in the future, they will belong to all users holding the debt.

### Debt Claim
    
Currently, 16,143 people have registered their debts, with 90% having completed the debt claim process. Users with debts under $100 can exchange XIN for immediate repayment.
    
### Repayment Plan
- 50% of users who have registered their debts have received immediate repayment through exchanging XIN.
- Participate in forming the Mixin Autonomous Organization, with 150,000 XIN (currently valued at approximately $40 million) as a basis to develop the Mixin ecosystem and compensate debt holders.
- Income generated from a series of Mixin team-developed products and investments, such as Mixin Safe, Mixin Wealth, Mixin Route, and Mixin Messenger â€” apart from retaining team expenses and development funds â€” will be used entirely for debt repayment, with a detailed plan expected to be announced in July-August.
