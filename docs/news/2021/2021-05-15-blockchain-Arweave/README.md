Arweave makes information permanence sustainable. Arweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever â€“ for the very first time. As a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, Arweave allows us to remember and preserve valuable information, apps, and history indefinitely. By preserving history, it prevents others from rewriting it.
