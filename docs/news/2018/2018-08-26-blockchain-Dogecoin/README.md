Mixin Network now supports the 11st blockchain Dogecoin, the ticker is DOGE, the official website is https://dogecoin.com/.

Dogecoin is an open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide. At its heart, Dogecoin is the accidental crypto movement that makes people smile! It is also an opensource peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that utilises blockchain technology, a highly secure decentralised system of storing information as a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers called nodes. More than this, though, is the ethos of Dogecoin, summarised in the Dogecoin Manifesto , and its amazing, vibrant community made up of friendly folks just like you!
