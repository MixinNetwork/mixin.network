Mixin Network now supports the 10th blockchain Zcash, the ticker is ZEC, the official website is https://z.cash/.

Zcash is a digital currency - fast and confidential with low fees. Zcash is a code fork of the bitcoin protocol and maintains its own blockchain and currency token. Zcash builds on the existing work from the Bitcoin core team to enable privacy preserving transaction data using zero-knowledge proofs. It also includes some non-privacy changes to bitcoin, including its proof of work algorithm.
