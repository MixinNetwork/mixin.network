Sia, decentralized data storage. Cryptography has unleashed the latent power of the Internet by enabling interactions between mutually-distrusting parties. Sia harnesses this power to create a trustless cloud storage marketplace, allowing buyers and sellers to transact directly. No intermediaries, no borders, no vendor lock-in, no spying, no throttling, no walled gardens; it's a return to the Internet we once knew. The future is making a comeback.
