Mixin Network now supports the 18th public chain Cosmos, the ticker is ATOM, the official website is https://cosmos.network/.

The Cosmos Network is a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable blockchains, creating the foundation for a new token economy. Cosmos solves some of the hardest blockchain problems of scalability, usability and interoperability. The Cosmos SDK is a developer-friendly, modular framework, each powered by a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus algorithm such as Tendermint BFT, allowing developers to fully customize their decentralized applications and focus on business logic.
