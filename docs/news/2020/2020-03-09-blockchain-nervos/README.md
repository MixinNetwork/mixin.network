Mixin Network now supports the 27th public chain Nervos, the token ticker is CKB, and the official website: https://www.nervos.org/.

The Nervos CKB is the fundamental Layer 1 Proof of Work blockchain, which creates the foundation for all layer 2 protocols, integrations, and scaling solutions for the Nervos Network. A core design principle at Nervos is that layer 2 solutions such as side-chains, plasma chains, and state channels are the best way to scale a blockchain system. Nervos CKB provides security and stability, and layer 2 provides performance and extension, such as support for smart contracts, adoption of PoS consensus algorithms, and so on.
