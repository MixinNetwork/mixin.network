Mixin Network now supports the 30th blockchain Tezos, the token ticker is XTZ, the official website is https://tezos.com/.

Tezos is designed to power the Web3 revolution. The future of the internet is being built on Tezos–with user participation and governance at its core. Users can directly and frictionlessly interface with each other over a decentralized network, exchanging value and interacting with various applications, without the need for intermediaries. On Tezos, Web3 can be a truly user-governed and user-centric movement, the way it was meant to be.
