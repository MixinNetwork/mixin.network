Mixin Network now supports the 30th blockchain Tezos, the token ticker is XTZ, the official website is https://tezos.com/.

Tezos is designed to power the Web3 revolution. The future of the internet is being built on Tezosâ€“with user participation and governance at its core. Users can directly and frictionlessly interface with each other over a decentralized network, exchanging value and interacting with various applications, without the need for intermediaries. On Tezos, Web3 can be a truly user-governed and user-centric movement, the way it was meant to be.
