Mixin Network now supports the 32nd blockchain Polkadot, the token ticker is DOT, the official website is https://polkadot.network/.

Polkadot is a sharded protocol that enables blockchain networks to operate together seamlessly. Polkadot unites and secures a growing ecosystem of specialized blockchains called parachains. Apps and services on Polkadot can securely communicate across chains, forming the basis for a truly interoperable decentralized web. The DOT token serves three distinct purposes: governance over the network, staking and bonding.
